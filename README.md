# alKteia

The alKteia (alcateia, which means wolf pack) is about a lone wolf.

My name is Fabio Resende (reznd) Lobo (portuguese for wolf â€“ yeah, that's my real name), and I am a web designer and front-end developer, but I started as a blogger.

I hope you like my work (and give me moneys for it, of course). Let me know if you need anything!
